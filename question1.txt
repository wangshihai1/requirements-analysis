请你将下面这段话翻译成英文，尽量翻译成专业术语：

"请你按照如下要求，根据输入的语句给出其对应的编码。我将会输入一个描述需求的语句，你需要给出用户满意程度随着指标变化的变化趋势。
例如：输入的需求语句为：“The search results shall be returned no later 30 seconds”，输出的编码形式为：“0 -1”，表示在30这个阈值的左侧，满意度是无差别的，当大于30后，满意度递减。
变化趋势的编码规则为：1表示满意度随着指标递增而递增；0表示满意度随着指标递增无差别；-1表示满意度随着指标递增而递减。
再给你10个输入输出的例子，请你结合理解，完成新的编码任务：
（1）输入：The system shall refresh the display every 60 seconds.   输出：-1 -1
（2）输入：The search results shall be returned no later 30 seconds  after the user has entered the search criteri.  输出：0 -1
（3）输入：The product shall generate a CMA report in an acceptable time.  输出：-1 -1
（4）输入：The system shall achieve 95% up time.  输出：1 0
（5）输入：The number of mistakes noted by the students shall be decreased by 50% in the first year.  输出：0 -1
（6）输入：100% of cardmember services representatives shall be able to successfully create a dispute case on the first encounter after completing the training course.  输出：1 0
（7）输入：The average number of recycled parts records per day shall be 50 000.   输出：1 -1
（8）输入： the time exceed 10 seconds should not be more than 10% of the time.  输出：0 -1
（9）输入：The product interface should be fast for 90% of the time.  输出：1 0
（10）输入：the system response time must be no more than 5 seconds.  输出：0 -1

请你按照上述示例，输出对于如下需求语句的编码（注意：只需要输出最终的编码即可，其他解释性的语言都不要输出，输出的是两个数字）：
The remaining 5% will be corrected and approved within one month of product release."

Please provide the corresponding encoding based on the input statement according to the following requirements. I will input a statement describing a requirement, and you need to give the trend of user satisfaction as the metric changes.
For example, the input requirement statement is: 'The search results shall be returned no later than 30 seconds', and the output encoding is: '0 -1', indicating that satisfaction is indifferent to the left of the 30-second threshold and decreases when it exceeds 30 seconds.
The encoding rules for the trend of change are: 1 indicates that satisfaction increases as the metric increases; 0 indicates that satisfaction is indifferent as the metric increases; -1 indicates that satisfaction decreases as the metric increases.
Here are 10 more input-output examples. Please complete the new encoding task based on your understanding:
(1) Input: The system shall refresh the display every 60 seconds. Output: -1 -1
(2) Input: The search results shall be returned no later than 30 seconds after the user has entered the search criteria. Output: 0 -1
(3) Input: The product shall generate a CMA report in an acceptable time. Output: -1 -1
(4) Input: The system shall achieve 95% uptime. Output: 1 0
(5) Input: The number of mistakes noted by the students shall be decreased by 50% in the first year. Output: 0 -1
(6) Input: 100% of cardmember services representatives shall be able to successfully create a dispute case on the first encounter after completing the training course. Output: 1 0
(7) Input: The average number of recycled parts records per day shall be 50,000. Output: 1 -1
(8) Input: The time exceeding 10 seconds should not be more than 10% of the time. Output: 0 -1
(9) Input: The product interface should be fast for 90% of the time. Output: 1 0
(10) Input: The system response time must be no more than 5 seconds. Output: 0 -1

Please follow the above examples and output the encoding (Note: Only output the final encoding as two digits, without any explanatory language) for the following requirement statement:
The remaining 5% will be corrected and approved within one month of product release.
