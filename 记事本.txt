A greater y is more preferred when y < x
A smaller y is more preferred when y < x
Any y is equally preferred when y < x

A greater y is more preferred when y > x
A smaller y is more preferred when y > x
Any y is equally preferred when y > x


A greater y is more preferred at any time
A smaller y is more preferred at any time
Any y is equally preferred at any time


Assume that y represents the demand indicator and x represents the threshold.
